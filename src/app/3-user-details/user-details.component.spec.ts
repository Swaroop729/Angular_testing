// Here we are testing the routing navigation for angular application. For that we might need the angular 
// routing class but it might involve a lot of complexity so instead we create a stub ( a duplicate implementation)
// for an router class instead of original router method.

// using the real router can happend but that includes the declration of real angular router moudule, 
// defining the routes change the implementations and also it would introuduce a lot of complexity, 
// some people might do it but on a personal front if we do that by using the angular router and to check
// the url after the navigate method is being called from router method. It is like we are testing angular 
// router instead of our own class so instead we can create a small stub and check if it is working properly by 
// declaring the methods we are using

// Also particularly for routing we might need to check the routes also since sometimes the path can be changed
// and when changed and we request to navigate to that path it might not exist so we need to have 
// one test for checking wether it has a user path defined for that particular route.
// second test for checking whether the route has being called on an event correctly.

// Also while checking for the router we need to check the router params also. In user details component
// if the user id is 0 we are rerouting it to not found page and that 0 is being read from route params.
// and here if we can see that the ActivatedRoute has replaced with ActivatedRouteStub so in the 
// ActivatedRouteStub we don't have anything to modify as the defined parameter so for that we create it 
// an observable that can send the value we require everytime an route params.

// In order to deal with the promises we will be using a different technique because while we are dealing 
// with promises other than subscribe method, the test are performed before and the successively the promise
// will be resolved this will happen because the promises are queued. And if this happens all our tests are
// going to fail, so in order for a workaround for this. we need a new technique to handle promises using async
